### Or "Things you Need to Know to Become Web Developer"

I've decided to put together a list of things one may need to become a self-taught web developer. I was thinking about building an online school, or course, or bootcamp, or something, but the reality is all of this information is available online almost entirely free and I doubt we need more of it. This doesn't aim to sell you anything, it's merely a list of links you may find helpful. I tried to list all skills you must know to get a job as paid intern or junior developer, a point from where you can continue studying but generate some income to support yourself. Web Development bootcamps usually take 12-16 weeks to train you for this, which roughly translates to 600-1000 hours. I think that's fair. You must be prepared to put in about 1000 hours of work before you can land your first job. It is entirely possible for you to get a 60k job in 6 months. But it requiresreal effort. Be prepared to put in 1000 hours. whether it's 10 or 4 hours a day, whether it's over 12 weeks or 50. You owe it 1000 hours.

### Who is This For?

This list is for somebody who's been thinking about taking a look at programming, but there are many paths to take, that it's 
difficult to choose. What do I learn C++, Java, AWS, iPhone apps, android apps, WordPress etc. There is about a gazillion types of 
coding-related professions out there, for example:
- android developer - builds apps for android;
- ios developer - builds apps for ios;
- DevOps engineer - does work in the cloud, maintains servers. this could be aws, azure, google cloud, on premise or something else;
- front end developer - somebody who builds the facade of a website. mainly works with HTML, CSS, javascript. whatever you see when you open a browser - that's what they do;
- back end developer - writes code that runs on a server, sits in between site and database. This usually supplies data for the front end;
- database engineer - somebody who works with a database. puts data in, takes it out, works with it. can do complex things efficiently;
- data science engineer, machine learning, and such... - glorified statistician as far as I understand.

... The list goes on. Furthermore, each of these includes many different types of languages and frameworks. You can be a back-end engineer writing in Python, Javascript, Ruby, Java, etc... I write in ruby and can help you learn skills I have to get the job I do. BTW, don't take that list seriously, I have no idea what I'm talking about here. Literally, I do not know - and here's why. We, developers, don't know everything. In fact, you'd be surprised how little we actually know. I am a web developer. I don't have a CS degree, I didn't go to college (mostly because I couldn't, not because I chose not to) As far as software engineering goes, what I do is probably easiest to master, and if I did it so can you. I have a fairly good understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, SQL (enough to get by), and some other miscellaneous things. Which makes me a front-end/back-end developer, sometimes people call it a full-stack developer. I know a little about cloud, have few AWS certifications, but I don't work with it professionally. These are the things I can NOT do:
- build a desktop application. like browser for example;
- build ios or android;
- I only know Ruby and Javascript. I don't know any other languages. I can learn if I need to, but I don't need to;
- I can't fix a computer;
- I understand very little about the network;
- I know very little about cloud, running/maintaining servers;
- I don't know what AI and/or machine learning is;
- I don't know math beyond 2 + 2 = something. But I do know what Big O is and how it affects my work;
- I can't really explain or reliably talk about log N, but I know I must not nest loops and you'll learn why too if you want to.

And yet I'm paid an above-average salary in the US. I have skills relevant to my job - and it's plenty to maintain for an average human being.
