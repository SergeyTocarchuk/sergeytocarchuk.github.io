### Or "Things you Need to Know to Become Web Developer"

I've decided to put together a list of things one may need to become a self-taught web developer. I was thinking about building an online school, or course, or bootcamp, or something, but the reality is all of this information is available online almost entirely free and I doubt we need more of it. This doesn't aim to sell you anything, it's merely a list of links you may find helpful. I tried to list all skills you must know to get a job as paid intern or junior developer, a point from where you can continue studying but generate some income to support yourself. Web Development bootcamps usually take 12-16 weeks to train you for this, which roughly translates to 600-1000 hours. I think that's fair. You must be prepared to put in about 1000 hours of work before you can land your first job. It is entirely possible for you to get a 60k job in 6 months. But it requiresreal effort. Be prepared to put in 1000 hours. whether it's 10 or 4 hours a day, whether it's over 12 weeks or 50. You owe it 1000 hours.

### Who is This For?

This list is for somebody who's been thinking about taking a look at programming, but there are many paths to take, that it's 
difficult to choose. What do I learn C++, Java, AWS, iPhone apps, android apps, WordPress etc. There is about a gazillion types of 
coding-related professions out there, for example:
- android developer - builds apps for android;
- ios developer - builds apps for ios;
- DevOps engineer - does work in the cloud, maintains servers. this could be aws, azure, google cloud, on premise or something else;
- front end developer - somebody who builds the facade of a website. mainly works with HTML, CSS, javascript. whatever you see when you open a browser - that's what they do;
- back end developer - writes code that runs on a server, sits in between site and database. This usually supplies data for the front end;
- database engineer - somebody who works with a database. puts data in, takes it out, works with it. can do complex things efficiently;
- data science engineer, machine learning, and such... - glorified statistician as far as I understand.

... The list goes on. Furthermore, each of these includes many different types of languages and frameworks. You can be a back-end engineer writing in Python, Javascript, Ruby, Java, etc... I write in ruby and can help you learn skills I have to get the job I do. BTW, don't take that list seriously, I have no idea what I'm talking about here. Literally, I do not know - and here's why. We, developers, don't know everything. In fact, you'd be surprised how little we actually know. I am a web developer. I don't have a CS degree, I didn't go to college (mostly because I couldn't, not because I chose not to) As far as software engineering goes, what I do is probably easiest to master, and if I did it so can you. I have a fairly good understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, SQL (enough to get by), and some other miscellaneous things. Which makes me a front-end/back-end developer, sometimes people call it a full-stack developer. I know a little about cloud, have few AWS certifications, but I don't work with it professionally. These are the things I can NOT do:
- build a desktop application. like browser for example;
- build ios or android;
- I only know Ruby and Javascript. I don't know any other languages. I can learn if I need to, but I don't need to;
- I can't fix a computer;
- I understand very little about the network;
- I know very little about cloud, running/maintaining servers;
- I don't know what AI and/or machine learning is;
- I don't know math beyond 2 + 2 = something. But I do know what Big O is and how it affects my work;
- I can't really explain or reliably talk about log N, but I know I must not nest loops and you'll learn why too if you want to.

And yet I'm paid an above-average salary in the US. I have skills relevant to my job - and it's plenty to maintain for an average human being.

### Tech Skills you Need

- Start a blog;
- HTML & CSS
- Git, Shell, Browser
- SQL
- Javascript
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails theory
- Ruby on Rails practice
- Ruby On Rails level-up
- Algorithms and Data Structures

The goal of this list is to give you the tools to build a website. That's it. All you need to do is learn how to build things. So when you read, learn, and practice, don't worry if you don't understand something, or if there is more to read and learn (hint: there always will be). All you need is to understand items in that list, be comfortable with each language, tool to the point that you can work with it. You don't have to know everything about everything perfectly, but you need to be able to work, search and ask good questions. And with practice, you'll get better and better.

The links that I provide below are here to get you started. It should be enough information to achieve the objective. But keep in mind that can simply google most of this and maybe even better resources. If some resource doesn't work for you, feel free to use another one or find something else. You can find free courses on youtube, for example, for any of these topics. If you want to buy a course - it's your show, but there is an abundance of free material out there, just look. If you decide to study according to this list, I encourage you to read this whole page, and go into each link and click around, see what' out there, some of these platforms, like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/), [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/), [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/) offer many courses, articles, books and you can find them helpful. For example, RailsBridge has links to HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. Check them out - maybe you'll like some of it.

Before we go there: **Start a blog.** Every day write down something you learned. This serves few purposes.

#### First, helps to land a job
When you're looking for your first junior job you won't have any experience to put on your resume, so your resume will look weak. For the interviewer it's very difficult to assess your skill set, having a blog will help here tremendously. How do they know you didn't just start yesterday? Well, they can see your posts from 6 months ago and can notice the progression from the very first "hello world" to "Here's how I avoid n+1 queries".

#### Second, it gives your thoughts a structure
There are few levels to understanding something:
- I think I understand
- I can write it down
- I can explain it to somebody else.

While you think you understand something, trying to put it on paper can be difficult. That's because thoughts are unorganized and chaotic. But paper... it's unforgiving, you can't mumble on paper. The pain you feel when you try to write - that's growing, that's structure emerging.

#### Last but not least, it's helpful to store information.
Sometimes down the line, you will have a problem and you'll be happy you can just open your blog, find the snippet, and copy-paste it.

Do write the blog. It's like an investment. It doesn't help you now and you limit yourself, but it pays off later. Keep in mind that your entries don't need to be 'smart' or groundbreaking, or even interesting. They can (and maybe even should) be the simplest, dumbest, most boring, straight-up stolen entries one can possibly come up with and that's ok. If you got stuck on something dumb for few hours make a note of it. If you learned some simple method that is obvious to you now but wasn't 5 minutes ago - make a note of it - you will be happy to have all this saved up when applying for a job.

### **HTML & CSS** (1-2 weeks)

Objective
Build some simple static pages, as in [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-projects).

Details
I think you can go over everything there is to know about HTML in one day, but let's say it will take few days. The same goes for CSS. Then take few days, up to few weeks to practice it.

Things you see in the browser, a.k.a websites, basically boil down to HTML & CSS. Just with these 2 you can build some fairly pretty and useful(!) static pages, websites. These aren't programming languages.

- HTML - hypertext markup language - tells browser WHAT to display;
- CSS - cascading style sheets - tells browser HOW to display it.

These are among the easiest to learn, concepts are straightforward. You don't need to remember/learn all the tags. Most commonly used will land in your head by themselves. everything else you should know how to find. There are a million resources online to learn this. From the list of links pick one (or 2) or find one online you like better and learn it.

### Browser, Git, Shell (1-2 weeks)
