## Installation

[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?dv=osx) for macOS and install it.

## Launching from the command line

You can also run VS Code from the terminal by typing 'code' after adding it to the path:

- Launch VS Code.
- Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.
- Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. 

Now you'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

## Several extensions

There are a lot of extensions, here are some I installed:

#### Ruby on Rails by Hridoy

This extension for Visual Studio Code adds snippets for Ruby on rails

#### VSCode Ruby by Stafford Brunk

This extension provides improved syntax highlighting, language configuration, and snippets to Ruby and ERB files within Visual Studio Code.

#### Emmet

Switch on Trigger expansion on tab: Emmet abbreviations are expanded when pressing Tab.
