Hi there!

I'm working on algorithms using the following resources:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/?page=1&topicSlugs=array&difficulty=EASY): there are a lot of problems for solving;
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/): get back to basics of JS;
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): if I need to dive into any special method of JS;
- and of course Console for running JS code.

Today I solved the following algorithms:
- 1. Two Sum
- 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- 27. Remove Element
- 35. Search Insert Position
- 53. Maximum Subarray

And get familier with the following methods: split, join, reverse.
Here is example of algorithms for reversing the provided string:
```
function reverseString(str) {
  return str
    .split("")
    .reverse()
    .join("");
}
```
