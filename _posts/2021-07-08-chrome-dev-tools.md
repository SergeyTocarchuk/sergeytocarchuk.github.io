The Chrome DevTools are an amazing tool and a critical part of our workflow.
This post will be added on my way of improvement in web development.

### Opening the DevTools

There are a handful of ways to get into the DevTools, but the primary way we use them is with the following keyboard shortcuts:

```
Cmd+Opt+i \\ Open the Dev Tools (to the last used tab)
```
