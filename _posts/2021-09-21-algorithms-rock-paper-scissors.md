I get back to previous task: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, and add User Interface to the game:
- you play with computer, so here is the fist function **computerPlay** that makes a random choice for computer;
- were added 3 buttons for User's choice and were implemented _addEventListener_ for the buttons;
- make some practice with Git as all additional features I wrote on featured branch: so I create new branch, commit and push there, switch between branches, merged featured branch into _master_ and delete it. All commands I save as how-to-do list in my [post]() about GitHub. 


All code you could find on [GitHub](https://github.com/SergeyTocarchuk/rock-paper-scissors).
